# Example fastlane setups

It's easier to get started with `fastlane` by taking a look at existing configurations. With [artsy](https://www.artsy.net/) being the first ones open sourcing their [Fastfile](https://github.com/artsy/eidolon/blob/master/fastlane/Fastfile).

If you like [fastlane](https://fastlane.tools) and would like to help this project by sharing your `Fastfile`, feel free to submit a pull request :+1:

Look at the file list on the top for a list of already added setups.
